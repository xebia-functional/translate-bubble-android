Translate Bubble for Android
============================

Translate Bubble is an application that facilitates the translation of text on your cell phone. You only has to copy any text to clipboard and immediately you will see a bubble appear on your screen with your translation. You don't even need to to leave your current application.

Scala on Android
==============

This application is written entirely in Scala on Android. We are excited to make the application open source and share the code with you. We have used the [macroid](http://macroid.github.io/) library extensively in this project. In addition we have contributed our own Macroid extenions to this application, that can be found here: [macroid-extras](https://github.com/47deg/macroid-extras).
